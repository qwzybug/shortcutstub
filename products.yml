  :price: 1200
  :description: ! 'The Obata variety’s nickname, “Brazilian Gesha,” owes largely to
    its breathtaking complexity in the cup: cranberry jam, fresh strawberry rhubarb
    pie, Merlot. But that’s not quite the full story. Obata, like Gesha, is also resistant
    to "coffee rust," a bronze-colored fungus that ravaged Central and South American
    farms last year. Thanks to its genetic strengths – and to some painstaking quality
    measures by the folks at Fazenda Ambiental Fortaleza – this coffee is both phlegmatic
    and kaleidoscopic.'

  :description: Cascara is made from the fruit that surrounds the coffee bean. The
    husk is separated from the seed, then raked and dried. This cascara comes to us
    from Aida Batlle’s Finca Tanzania. We’ve worked with Aida for four years, and
    carried her cascara for two. To yield the most delicious results, steep 5-8 grams
    of cascara in 325 ml of 201 F water for five minutes. Alone, it’s crystalline;
    with a drop of honey, it’s decadent.

  :description: ! 'The Las Brisas comes to us from a collection of farmers in Colombia’s
    Tolima department, which is situated between a forest preserve and a national
    park near the country’s Western edge. Coffee cherries – mostly Typica and Caturra
    varieties, cultivated on 3-4 hectare farms – are selected with fussy precision,
    then processed on hand-crank de-pulping machines. From there, they’re laid on
    raised beds under translucent covers, which deflect the persistent (and unpredictably
    timed) equatorial rains. And since we’re on the topic of weather, it’s worth noting
    that “brisa” means “breeze” in Spanish. For our money, we couldn’t have invented
    a better meteorological analog to this coffee’s character: From pour-overs, expect
    cumulus wisps of cherry, chocolate and citrus. Espresso shots, meanwhile, yield
    thickly fruited clusters of raisin, currant and vanilla – and, in turn, a sensation
    comparable to a humid blast of pre-thunderstorm wind that howls fiendishly and
    bends daffodils in improbable directions. '

    designers, each committed to an easier and more delightful home coffee experience.
    We knew that we’d have to start shipping a lot more coffee each week. We knew
    we’d have to knock down a wall in our office and order bunch of new chairs. Yet
    amid all the bustle, we nearly forgot one of the most important features of joining
    forces with another splendid coffee company: the coffee! Originally sourced by
    our pals at Tonx, the Cauca Popayán represents the best selections from about
    100 members of Colombia’s APROCEP coffee organization, located in the country’s
    coffee-rich Cauca department. It’s pleasantly versatile as a drip, with flecks

    pepper and butterscotch swell in sublime succession.'

    this coffee, harvested in Suaza, a small town in Colombia’s coffee-rich Huila
    region, is the delicious product of just one day’s picking and processing. Taken
    at face value, that factoid might not seem like an enormous to-do. But it’s worth
    a second thought, especially when you consider that some processing facilities
    in the area bring in as much as five million pounds of coffee cherry per day.
    (In this case, we’re dealing with 1,500 kilos, or just about 3,300 pounds.) Thanks
    to the hard work of producer Javier Cantillo, who scrutinizes picking, lot separation,
    and drying on all of his coffee, this selection explodes with lime zest, chamomile,
    bing cherry, and pine honey. Its finish is equal parts luxurious and unexpected:
    the peppery spice of butter basil, followed by a wink of La Bohème sour ale. '

  :description: ! 'Imagine, if you will, a perfect apple slice, slathered in perfect
    caramel sauce and served on a piece of glittering china. Imagine that this apple
    was coddled from a seed: its nutrients closely administered, its access to sunlight
    dutifully monitored, its skin polished to a retina-threatening sheen. The caramel,
    meanwhile, was derived from only the most succulent of sugars, then browned to
    copper perfection. Why do all this imagining? Well because it’s a handy analogue
    for understanding our Colombia Las Margaritas Pacamara Honey, an exquisite selection
    from our friends and partners at Granja La Esperanza. Coffee cherries at the farm
    are grown and selected with care by some of the country’s most experienced cultivators
    (weak seedlings, meanwhile, are burned), then they’re honey-processed – a technique
    in which sugar-rich mucilage clings to the seeds as they dry in the sun. The result
    of all this work is a coffee that vibrates with malic tartness and the slightest
    hint of bruléed brown sugar. When correctly prepared, it feels to us a bit like
    strolling through a well-maintained orchard, our nose tickled by the October wind,
    our hands still sticky from the glazed doughnut we vowed (unsuccessfully) not
    to consume in one bite.'

    regularly rakes in awards – they won three of the Specialty Coffee Association
    of America’s 10 “Coffee of the Year” honors in 2012. But the true mark of their

    in point: The Las Margaritas. A Red Bourbon variety (named after “Reunion,” an

    To boot, it’s at an altitude of 1,650 meters – a breath-snatching height that’s
    ideal for coffee cultivation, albeit less than splendid for rusty Jeeps. Gikirima’s
    producers, a fastidious bunch, apply a careful hand to their fermenting, drying,
    conditioning, and storing operations. The result of their labor is a luxurious:
    a gooey cinnamon bun of a coffee, finished with the gentlest etching of citrus.
